# Climate Change: A Global Narrative

An interactive narrative visualization exploring the impact of climate change through data storytelling.

## Overview

This project implements a narrative visualization following the **interactive slideshow** structure, guiding users through three key scenes that tell the story of climate change:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures** - Shows temperature anomalies from 1880-2023
2. **Carbon Emissions by Region** - Displays global CO2 emissions distribution
3. **Renewable Energy Growth** - Demonstrates the rise of clean energy solutions

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth transitions between scenes with progress tracking
- **Consistent Visual Design**: Unified color scheme and typography across all scenes
- **Data-Driven Annotations**: Strategic annotations highlighting key insights
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys and spacebar for navigation
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over data points for detailed information

## Technical Implementation

- **D3.js v7**: For all data visualization components
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For narrative logic and state management
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure

## Narrative Structure

This visualization follows the **interactive slideshow** pattern, where:
- Users can explore data within each scene through tooltips
- Navigation is controlled but allows for user interaction
- Each scene builds upon the previous one to tell a complete story
- The narrative progresses from problem identification to solution exploration

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure and styling
- `narrative.js` - Core narrative logic and D3 visualizations
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the navigation buttons or keyboard arrows to move between scenes
3. Hover over data points for additional information
4. Follow the narrative progression to understand the climate change story

## Data Sources

The visualization uses synthesized data that represents realistic climate change trends:
- Temperature data follows historical warming patterns
- Emissions data reflects current global distribution
- Renewable energy data shows exponential growth trends

## Educational Value

This narrative visualization demonstrates:
- How to structure a compelling data story
- Effective use of annotations and visual hierarchy
- Interactive design principles
- D3.js implementation best practices
